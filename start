Update January 3rd, 2018: If you're using AWS or Codeanywhere then you can find all solution files/code here -https://github.com/nax3t/webdevbootcamp

Congratulations on making it to the backend section of this course!

This is a quick note to explain where you can find solution code from here on out. Every single bit of code I type from now until the end of the course is available on this course's publicly visible Cloud9 workspace: https://ide.c9.io/learnwithcolt/webdevbootcamp

I recommend that you bookmark that workspace URL

All you have to do is open up the correct folder/files by clicking on the folder tree on the left hand side.

For example, if you wanted to view the solution from the "Our First Express App" lesson, all you need to do is visit https://ide.c9.io/learnwithcolt/webdevbootcamp and then open the "IntroToExpress" folder and then open "FirstExpressApp", and you have access to all the files in the application.
